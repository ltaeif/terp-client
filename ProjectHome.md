TERP is a text-mode ERP client implemented in python-curses that works with OpenERP backends (we will also try to add Tryton backend support within the same client since it uses the same architecture).

The goal of TERP is to enable users to perform any kind of ERP operations quickly from a terminal.

Thanks to [Almacom (Thailand)](http://almacom.co.th/) and [Syleam](http://syleam.fr/) for sponsoring this project.
